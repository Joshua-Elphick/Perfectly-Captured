               <p> Born in Hamilton, New Zealand, raised there, still live there. Went to school thinking I would come out of it being a Docter or lawyer, or something of the like. But I guess I found that, that was not what I wanted to do well that and I was terrible at public speaking. At an early age photos were a reminder of the past, and often photos were a nessicaty<!-- UMMM SPELL--> of family gatherings. Soon I was given my first camera and with it a desire to follow this path. Photography became a way for me to express my opinion on certain subjects through out the world, such as still-art, family, and just general nature. The feeling of being able to create memories in a click of a button allowed me to roam. Through the loss of family memebers I learned truely that photos can speak more than a thousand words and will always give a story.
                <br><br>
                So now I take photos for everyone allowing people to be able to gain memories of anything. Whether it be a family photo, school ball, end of year party, whatever it may be here at Perfectly Captured I am to give you that Perfectly Captured Memory. </p>
